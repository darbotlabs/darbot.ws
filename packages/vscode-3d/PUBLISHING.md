# Publishing three.ws 3D

How to release `threews.vscode-3d` to the
[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) and to
[Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org) (the registry VSCodium, Cursor, Windsurf,
Gitpod and other VS Code forks install from). Official references:
[Publishing Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension)
and the [Open VSX publishing guide](https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx/wiki/Publishing-Extensions).

This file is excluded from the `.vsix` by `.vscodeignore`.

## Where things stand

- **Publisher identity is resolved.** `package.json` declares
  `"publisher": "threews"`. That publisher already exists on the Visual Studio
  Marketplace (display name "three.ws", verified, with another three.ws
  extension live under it), so no new publisher has to be created. The
  `threews` namespace also already exists on Open VSX.
- **The package is ready.** `npm run package` builds a production bundle and
  writes `vscode-3d-0.2.0.vsix`: 15 files, about 694 KB. It has been installed
  into a real VS Code 1.138.0 server build with
  `code-server --install-extension`, and `--list-extensions` reports
  `threews.vscode-3d@0.2.0`.
- **What only the owner has:** a Marketplace token for the `threews` publisher
  and an Open VSX token for the `threews` namespace. Neither is stored on this
  machine.

## 0. Preflight (one minute)

```bash
cd packages/vscode-3d
npm ci
npm test                      # 71 tests, must all pass
npm run package               # builds and writes vscode-3d-<version>.vsix
npx --yes @vscode/vsce ls --no-dependencies   # the exact file list that ships
```

The list must be `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `package.json`,
`dist/extension.cjs`, `media/icon.png`, `media/cube.svg`, `media/viewer.css`,
`media/viewer.js`, and the four decoder files under `media/vendor/`. Anything
else (sources, tests, source maps, `node_modules`) means `.vscodeignore` has
regressed. Delete the `.vsix` afterwards; it is gitignored and never committed.

Marketplace rules the package already satisfies, worth keeping when editing:
the icon is a 128x128 PNG (SVG icons are rejected), the README uses only
absolute `https` links and no SVG images, `repository`, `bugs`, `homepage`,
`license`, `pricing`, `galleryBanner`, `categories` and `keywords` are set, and
`engines.vscode` matches `@types/vscode`. A version can be published only once:
bump `version` in `package.json` and add a `CHANGELOG.md` section for every
release after 0.2.0.

## 1. Visual Studio Marketplace

### 1a. Get access to the `threews` publisher

1. Sign in at <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage> with the Microsoft
   account that owns the `threews` publisher. If you are a different account,
   the owner adds you under **threews > Members** with the **Contributor** role.
2. Only if the publisher were ever missing: **Create publisher** on the same
   page, ID `threews`, name `three.ws`. The ID must equal the `publisher` field.

### 1b. Create a Personal Access Token

1. Open <https://dev.azure.com>. Any Azure DevOps organization under the same
   Microsoft account works; create one if the account has none.
2. User settings (top right) > **Personal access tokens** > **New Token**.
3. **Organization: All accessible organizations.** A token scoped to one
   organization fails with a 401 at publish time.
4. **Scopes: Custom defined > Show all scopes > Marketplace > Manage.**
5. Pick an expiry, create, and copy the token.

### 1c. Log in and publish

```bash
cd packages/vscode-3d
npx --yes @vscode/vsce login threews        # paste the token when prompted
npx --yes @vscode/vsce verify-pat threews   # optional sanity check
npm run publish:marketplace
```

`publish:marketplace` runs `vsce publish --no-dependencies`, which runs the
production build (`vscode:prepublish`), packages, and uploads. The bundles
already contain every runtime dependency, so `--no-dependencies` is correct.

Non-interactive alternative: `VSCE_PAT=<token> npm run publish:marketplace`.
If the account signs in through Microsoft Entra ID instead of a token:
`az login`, then `npx --yes @vscode/vsce publish --no-dependencies --azure-credential`.

## 2. Open VSX (free second listing)

1. Sign in at <https://open-vsx.org> with the GitHub account that is a member of
   the `threews` namespace (the account that published the existing three.ws
   extension there). The Eclipse Foundation publisher agreement must be signed
   under **Settings**; it already is if that account published before.
2. **Settings > Access Tokens > Generate New Token**, copy it.
3. Publish:

```bash
cd packages/vscode-3d
OVSX_PAT=<token> npm run publish:openvsx
```

`publish:openvsx` runs `ovsx publish --no-dependencies`, which builds and
packages the same way. To upload the exact file already published to the
Marketplace instead: `npx --yes ovsx publish vscode-3d-0.2.0.vsix -p <token>`.

The namespace is currently unverified on Open VSX, so the listing shows a
warning badge. To remove it, claim the namespace by opening an issue at
<https://github.com/EclipseFdn/open-vsx.org/issues> (template "Claim namespace
ownership"). This is optional and does not block publishing.

## 3. Verify the release

Marketplace listings pass an automated scan first, usually within a few
minutes, before the page and install work.

```bash
# Marketplace: the gallery API returns the published version
curl -s -X POST 'https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/gallery/extensionquery' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json;api-version=7.2-preview.1' \
  -d '{"filters":[{"criteria":[{"filterType":7,"value":"threews.vscode-3d"}]}],"flags":1}' \
  | grep -o '"version":"[^"]*"' | head -1

# Open VSX: the registry API returns the published version
curl -s https://open-vsx.org/api/threews/vscode-3d | grep -o '"version":"[^"]*"'

# A real install into a clean profile
code --user-data-dir /tmp/vsc3d-profile --extensions-dir /tmp/vsc3d-ext \
  --install-extension threews.vscode-3d
code --user-data-dir /tmp/vsc3d-profile --extensions-dir /tmp/vsc3d-ext \
  --list-extensions --show-versions
```

Then check by hand:

1. <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=threews.vscode-3d>
   shows the icon, the dark banner, the README with working links, and the
   changelog tab.
2. <https://open-vsx.org/extension/threews/vscode-3d> shows the same.
3. In VS Code, open any `.glb` (for example a model from
   <https://three.ws>): it renders in the **three.ws 3D Viewer** tab, the
   **three.ws 3D** activity bar icon lists workspace models, and
   **3D: Generate a Model from Text** returns a model.

## 4. After the first publish

- In `docs/vscode.md`, replace the "not on the Marketplace yet" install section
  with the Marketplace and Open VSX install, matching this package's README.
- Add a `data/changelog.json` entry announcing the listing (tags `feature`,
  `sdk`) and run `npm run build:pages` from the repository root.
- Set the "VS Code Marketplace: three.ws 3D" row in
  `marketing/growth/opportunities.csv` to `live`, with the listing URL as
  evidence.
