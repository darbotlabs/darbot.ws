# MKT-2026-11-GCP-AGENT: a production A2A agent with a browser-native 3D interface

**Kit status:** copy complete and **held behind three blockers.** Nothing announcing a Google Cloud
listing may post until the listing exists; this kit also carries a fallback post that is true today.

## Blockers (verified 2026-09-17)

1. **Vertex AI is billing-denied on the production project.** Cloud Run logs for `three-ws-api` at
   2026-09-17T03:12Z read `vertex imagen failed, falling back: Lightning dunning decision is deny for
   project: projects/93741856042`. Google's AI agent listing requirements ask an A2A agent to use a Model
   Garden model as its default; production cannot today. Clear the billing hold first.
2. **The Agent Card is not yet a valid Marketplace Agent Card.** `https://three.ws/.well-known/agent-card.json`
   (version 1.5.1, 10 skills) has no `protocolVersion`, no `preferredTransport`, no
   `securitySchemes`/`security` (it uses the older `authentication` key), and its `url` is the website
   `https://three.ws/`, not the A2A endpoint. Full gap table:
   [marketing/partner-packets/google-cloud-ai-agents.md](../../partner-packets/google-cloud-ai-agents.md).
3. **No Partner Network enrollment.** three.ws is a member of Google Cloud for Web3 Startups, not a Google
   Cloud Partner, and has no Marketplace listing (campaigns.csv status `awaiting_enrollment`).

## X

**Launch anchor, only after the listing is live** (175 weighted characters measured with a placeholder
Marketplace URL):

```text
three.ws is listed in Google Cloud Marketplace as an A2A agent: a prompt in, a rigged, embeddable 3D character out, served from Cloud Run: {{LISTING_URL}} @googlecloud
```

**Fallback, true today, if the owner wants the campaign slot used before the listing** (177):

```text
Our Agent Card is public JSON: ten declared skills an agent can read before it calls anything, from avatar search to GLB validation. Served by Cloud Run: https://three.ws/.well-known/agent-card.json?utm_source=x&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=mkt-2026-11-gcp-agent&utm_content=fallback
```

**Media:** a capture of `{{LISTING_URL}}` for the launch anchor; `forge.png` for the fallback.
**Alt text (fallback):** The three.ws Forge page: a prompt box, quality and engine selectors, and a
Generate button.

## LinkedIn (launch day)

```text
Agents built for the enterprise mostly answer in text. Some questions deserve an object.

three.ws is now available in Google Cloud Marketplace as an AI agent that speaks the A2A protocol. Other agents can read its public Agent Card, see its declared skills, and call it to turn a prompt or a photo into a textured, rigged 3D character that can be inspected, placed in a room in AR, or embedded on a page with one tag.

The agent runs on Google Cloud in production: Cloud Run serves the API, a Cloud Run GPU fleet runs 3D generation, rigging, and motion, and Cloud Scheduler runs the background jobs. Procurement goes through the Google Cloud account your organization already uses.

three.ws is a member of Google Cloud for Web3 Startups.

## three.ws news blurb

three.ws is available in Google Cloud Marketplace as an A2A agent: other agents can read its Agent Card
and call it to generate rigged, embeddable 3D characters from a prompt or photo. It runs on the same
Cloud Run and GPU stack that serves three.ws. Listing: {{LISTING_URL}}.

## Partner message

Step 1 has no message: enroll at `https://partners.cloud.google.com/enrollment`. After enrollment, and
only after blockers 1 and 2 are closed, send this to the partner manager Google assigns (no contact name
exists in the repo):

```text
Subject: three.ws A2A agent: AI Agents program validation and agent finder placement

three.ws (Partner ID {{PARTNER_ID}}) runs its production stack on Google Cloud: Cloud Run for the API and a Cloud Run GPU fleet for 3D generation, rigging, and motion. Our A2A agent is onboarded in Producer Portal as {{PRODUCER_PORTAL_PRODUCT}}, with the Agent Card uploaded to Cloud Storage and a Model Garden model as the default.

Two asks: route the agent into AI Agents program validation (and Gemini Enterprise validation if it qualifies), and confirm how an approved listing is placed in the AI agent finder at cloud.withgoogle.com/agentfinder.

The forwardable packet, architecture, and business case are attached.
```

Attach the forwardable packet and architecture section from the Google Cloud packet, with its metrics
re-read on the day.

Dropped: generation totals and uptime percentages (quoted in the packet with 2026-09-16 capture dates;
re-read on sending day rather than frozen into public copy), and "Vertex AI powers the agent" (false while
billing is denied).

## Owner does

Clear the Vertex billing hold and enroll at `partners.cloud.google.com/enrollment`; the Agent Card fixes
are engineering work that needs no approval.
