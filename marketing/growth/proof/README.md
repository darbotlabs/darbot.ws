# Anchor campaign proof

Every anchor campaign in [`campaigns.csv`](../campaigns.csv) leads with visible proof (see
"The campaign format" in the [command center](../README.md)). This folder holds that proof,
captured from the live production site in a real Chromium, so nobody has to take screenshots
by hand on posting day.

## Regenerate

```bash
node scripts/capture-campaign-proof.mjs                              # every anchor row
node scripts/capture-campaign-proof.mjs --only MKT-2026-10-NVIDIA-DH # one campaign
node scripts/capture-campaign-proof.mjs --no-video                   # stills only
node scripts/capture-campaign-proof.mjs --base http://localhost:3000 # the working tree
```

The script reads the anchor rows of `campaigns.csv`, opens each three.ws `anchor_proof` URL,
waits for the network to settle and any WebGL canvas to paint, and writes into
`<campaign_id>/`:

| File | What it is | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `desktop@2x.png` | 1600x900 viewport at 2x (3200x1800), lossless | Partner-domain articles, decks, press |
| `x-1600x900.jpg` | The same frame at exactly 1600x900, JPEG under 5 MB | The X anchor post and Telegram |
| `mobile@3x.png` | 390x844 phone viewport at 3x (1170x2532) | LinkedIn, community posts, mobile proof |
| `motion-15s.mp4` | 15 seconds of the running surface, H.264, faststart, under 8 MB | Social clips on surfaces that move |

Floating site chrome (the getting-started stack, the walking companion, the language
button) is hidden so the product surface fills the frame. Nothing on the surface is edited.
Each campaign's recipe (what it shows, whether it records a clip, how it is framed) lives in
the `RECIPES` table at the top of the script; a new anchor row needs one entry there.

[`manifest.json`](./manifest.json) records every file's byte size, sha256, dimensions,
duration, source URL, and capture time. The tables below are generated from it.

## Commit gate

three.ws only promotes $THREE. When a captured frame shows the name of another coin or token,
the script prints the terms it saw. The owner approved (2026-09-18) proof media that shows the
payment rails a three.ws page prices in, USDC and SOL (the `APPROVED_TOKEN_TERMS` set in the
script). Any other token name marks the file `gated` in the manifest: it stays on disk, is not
committed until the owner approves that specific content, and is listed below as held, without
a link.
